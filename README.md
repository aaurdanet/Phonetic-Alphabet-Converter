Phonetic Alphabet Converter

This Python script converts a given word into its NATO phonetic alphabet representation. It utilizes a CSV file containing the NATO phonetic alphabet, then creates a dictionary mapping each letter to its corresponding phonetic code.
Overview

This script comprises the following steps:

Import pandas Library: The script begins by importing the pandas library.

Read CSV File: It reads the CSV file nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv containing the NATO phonetic alphabet and creates a dictionary (nato_dict) mapping each letter to its corresponding phonetic code.

User Input: The script prompts the user to enter a word.

Convert Word to Phonetic Representation: It converts the input word into a list of characters. Then, it uses list comprehension to map each character to its phonetic representation based on the nato_dict. If a character does not have a corresponding phonetic representation in the dictionary, it assigns None to it.

Print Output: The script prints the phonetic representation of the input word.
